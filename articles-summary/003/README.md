### Abstract

- **Gap**
    - Pharmaceutical market in Iran is the biggest expenditure in all the health care system.
    - In the last decades health care costs had a significant increase.
    - Many factors effects this market, including sanctions, shortages, past policies, and disease trends.
- **Method**
    - Quantitative analysis.
    - Past 17 year Iranian pharmaceutical market (2000-2016)
    - Therapeutic categories added to classify the market trends
- **Results**
    - Rapid growth in pharmaceutical market in last 5 years (2011-2016) from $3.847B to $5.183B (compound annual growth rate of 6.14%).
    - The leader in this rapid growth were, antidiabetics (drugs used to lower the sugar percentage in blood) and antineoplastic agents (drugs to treat cancer).
    - The new immerging trend of diseases belongs to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
    - New molecules discover also had it’s own effect on the trends.
- **Conclusions**
    - We need well-informed decision making in governance level, in order to decrease the pressure on health care system in Iran.
    - In this research we put the first efforts to find the trends for latter informed-decision making in governance level. To prevent cost charges on pharmaceutical segment.

### Introduction

- **Background:**
    - Demographic information of Iran provided
    - Economical information also added (both in country level and health care segment)
        - Total GDP
        - GDP in healthcare
        - Private sector is the dominant expenditure in this segment (59%) and others belongs to the public sector.
        - Health expenditures per capita is also reported ($351)
        - 12.7% of all the healthcare expenditures belongs to the pharmaceutical segment.
    - Pharmaceutical market from the history
        - In past decades, several events and policies effect the market remarkably.
            - Governance financial support to this segment
            - Sanctions
            - Significant drop in the value of national currency.
            - Extensive drug shortages
            - Healthcare system reform.
            - Changing the pharmaceutical industry to a more private sector.
            - Government policies to protect the pharmaceutical market from competition and globalization by imposing regulatory measures.
        - The domination and control of the government is still exist on the market, yet it’s believed that it won’t last for long.
- Aims
    - This research aims to make a solid ground for future decision making policies and serves as base for policymakers to allocate the resources in this segment.
    - Find if any significant shift happened in therapeutic classes during last 17 years.
    - Forecast the top therapeutic classes in 5-years future.

### Method

- Descriptive and cross-sectional study.
- Quantitative analysis of the past 17 years data (2000 to 2016) of Iran pharmaceutical market.
- This study is a complementary update for another study conducted in 2013.
- They used ATC code for drug classification
- The data used gathered from IFDA.
- In this study about 3300 different dosage forms of around 1400 drug molecules available in the Iran drug list (IDL) were classified based on their respective ATC codes.
- Sales values are also presented in US$ following with exchange rate reported by Iran Central bank (which is the official currency exchange rate used in the pharmaceutical industry)
- They used the data reported from producers and distributors and warned that this may not be a valid data for drug consumption (however this was the closest correlation to the consumption and the article used it)
- Six statistical forecasting models also provided for the period of 3, 5, or 10 years.
    - Linear model
    - Exponential Model
    - Polynomial model (order 2 and 3)
    - Logarithmic Model
    - Moving Average
    - Compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
- A panel of eight pharmaceutical market experts selected the appropriate pattern of medicine consumption for each ATC group to find the best retrospective and futuristic data fitting and forecast approach through to 2022.
- Three different criteria were selected for the demonstration of results which included actual CAGR (2011–2016), forecasted CAGR (2017–2022), and average market share (2014–2016)

- Experts tried rank the classes based on their attractiveness. This attractivity ranking is contemplated as a market attractivity driving force to help predict the trends of each therapeutic class, assuming that the most attractive classes will take the market growth lead.

- Drugs used in diabetes and drugs for acid‑related disorders are the dominant groups with 36.5% and 25.3% share in 2016, respectively, while drugs used in diabetes have been the second fast‑growing subgroup with a CAGR(2011–2016) of 30.1%.
- We categorized the ATC groups into four types based on their past (actual) and future (forecasted) annual growth rates and their market positioning.
    1. Groups with past and future growth rates higher than the overall market average: Alimentary tract and metabolism (including drugs used in diabetes), antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, blood and blood‑forming organs, nervous system, and cardiovascular system.
    2. Groups with past and future growth rates lower than the overall market average: Anti‑infectives for systemic use, respiratory system, musculoskeletal system, systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins, and sensory organs.
    3. Groups with previously higher growth rates, but lower future growth rates compared to the market average: Antiparasitic products, insecticides, and repellents.
    4. Groups with lower growth rate in the past, but higher growth rate in the future, with regard to the market average: Genitourinary system and sex hormones and dermatologicals.

### My Recommendations for future work

- Use more sophisticated models to predict the future (ANNs, ML methods, etc.)
- Combine the available data with more demographic data.
- Use more powerful time series prediction models (ARIMA, etc.)
