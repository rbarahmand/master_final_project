### Title

- **Keywords:** additive manufacturing, drug delivery application
- **Terms:**
    - Drug administrations: Drug administration is *the giving of a drug by one of several means (routes*).
    - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs): Side effects, also known as adverse reactions, are unwanted undesirable effects that are possibly related to a drug
    - Pharmacogenetics focuses on the influence of single genes on drug response, while pharmacogenomics takes a broader view of the influence of an individual's entire genome on their response to drug therapy.
    - Additive Manufacturing (AM)

### Abstract

- **Research gap:** traditional health care relays on ‘on-size-fits-all’ method, and the effect of drug it’s amount for individuals, is not considered, also each patient reflect differently to each prescribed medicines.
- **Method**
    - Use pharmacogenetic testing
    - Use additive manufacturing techniques (3D printing)
    - Wide ranges of 3D printing techniques provide the access to many bio-materials
    - Patient-centric principle
- **Results**
    - Systematic review of additive manufacturing techniques in drug delivery
    - Segmentations and categories discussed
        - materials
        - methods of drug administrations
        - techniques used for printing
        - manufacturing of polypills
        - varied release profiles and geometries
    - Feasibility studies also conducted
    - 4D printing also discussed

### Introduction

- **Background:**
    - Patients results varied towards the administration of particular drugs, because of:
        - Different health background
        - Metabolism
        - Genetics
    - Future of drug production: mass production → personalized dosage phenomenon
    - Currently available options for changing the dosage of drugs specially, standard tablets, are either splitting or digestion of multiple ones, that is not a good option.
    - ADRs report:
        - England, Germany and US as 2.3%, 4.8%, 7.3% respectively.
        - India estimated to be 2–3%
    - Emerging from the field of pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics has been seen as a path towards achieving personalized medicine
- **Aims and intentions:** study the feasibility of additive manufacturing in the field of drug delivery applications. The questions tends to be answered:
    1. What are the existing technologies of drug delivery systems?
    2. Up to what extent has the additive manufacturing been successful in pursuit of personalized medication?
    3. What are the advancements required to further consolidate the importance of AM in the field of pharmaceutical applications?

- Biomaterials for 3D printing: It should be biocompatible, biodegradable, easy-toprepare, non-toxic and affordable.
    - Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)
    - Polylactic acid (PLA)
    - Polycaprolactone (PCL)
    - Polyethylene glycol (PEG)
    - Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)
    - Titanium (Ti)
    - Hydrogels
- Drug loading methods
    - Mixing
    - Hot-Melt Extrusion
    - Soaking/absorption
    - Coating
    - Electrodeposition
    - Injection
- AM techniques for drug delivery devices
    - Material extrusion
        - Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)/Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)
        - Syringe extrusion (SE)/Semi-solid extrusion (SSE)
    - Vat polymerization
        - Stereolithography (SLA)
        - Digital light processing (DLP)
        - Continuous Liquid Interface production (CLIP)
    - Binder Jetting (Inkjet Printing)
    - Direct Energy Deposition (DED)
        - Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS)
    - Powder bed fusion
        - Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
        - Selective Laser Melting (SLM)
        - Electron Beam Melting (EBM)
    - Material Jetting
    - Sheet lamination
- Issues related to quality
    - Drug degration
    - Drug loading
    - Inefficient release
    - Issues during printing
        - Filaments need to be compatible in terms of strength, flexibility and density
        - The choice of wavelength of UV lights
        - In drop-on-powder type printing, there is a need to keep a vigil on physicochemical properties of the ink like viscosity, surface tension.
- Existing Methods: (Traditional)
    - Oral drug regime → AM capable
    - Oro-Dispersible Film (ODF) → AM capable
    - Scaffolds → AM capable
    - Implants → Better with AM
    - Transdermal patches → AM capable
    - Rectal/vaginal → AM capable
    - Meshes → Better with AM
    - Catheter → Better with AM

### Future Opportunities

- **4D printing and beyond:** It can create more complex shapes, as it has more DOM to move on.
- **Combination of processes:** For example, using a combination of 3D method FDM and 2D based inkjet printing in a single step
- **Use of nanoparticles:** to improve the percentage of drug loaded, better mechanical behavior, improve osseo-genetic capabilities
- Machine Learning (ML):
    - Reduce the fabrication time through optimized use of available materials and facilities.
    - limited availability of data related to printing behaviour of the bio-materials.
- **Cost factor:** Installation of an AM machine is fairly costly
- Regulatory compliances:
