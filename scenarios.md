# Scenarios

## 1st scenario (drug production, price, economics, and ethics)

### Problem

**Base on the data from Amarnameh, and other datasets, What drugs has the most uses? What segments they were used for? Check the dead ratios, and their cause and it’s relation with drugs in those years.**

- **Sub scenario 1: (Investigate on the business side)**
  - What are the drugs production trends over the years?
  - What are the drugs consumption trends over the years?
  - What are the price trends in top drug segments?
- **Sub scenario 2: (Investigate on the ethics and macro economic side)**
  - Check macro economic metrics
    - Drug GDP
    - CAGR metric
    - Other KPIs
  - Ethics and governance
    - What was the governments decisions and their effects on people health?
    - What was the drug producers policies that affects people lives?

## 2nd scenario (R&D, herbal treatment, and drug discovery)

### Problem

**Find top 10 drugs used in Iran, compare their R&Ds with equivalent producers in modern and well developed countries.**

- **Sub scenario 1: (Drug quality, and it’s effect on patients)**
  - The effect of active ingredients in drugs.
  - R&Ds in Iran and other companies and it’s effect on people health.
- **Sub scenario 2: (Cost optimization effect of R&D drugs)**
  - Combination of different drugs and it’s effects on minimizing the cost of production and packaging of previously used separate drugs.
  - Investigate on the R&D impact on new drugs.
  - Study the feasibility of health guarantee on R&D drugs (to gain the interest of costumers)
- **Sub scenario 3: (Herbal treatments, it’s R&D, and opportunities in Iran)**
  - Similar products in other companies
    - India: vicks plant
  - Needed R&D to produce different use-shapes of these drugs
  - Opportunities in Iran for herbal treatments.
    - رزماری
    - گزنه
    - گون
    - راجونه
    - آناهیل
    - کرفس
    - سیر
    - زرچوبه

## 3rd scenario (environment and sustainability)

### Problem

Base on the policies and data provided by United Nation, rules and policies for SDGs (sustainability development goals), find datasets for drugs and it’s effects on environment, human health, and it’s usage in developed countries, in Global and Iran.

### Investigation

-

## 4th scenario (start with death ratios)

### Problem

Base on top 10 cause of death base on health problems and illness, find the most effective drugs, their price trends, the amount of R&Ds go through them, their usage trends, economical metrics, and checking the effect of human diverse genetics on these different drugs. Finally compare the global results with Iran.

### Investigation

-

## 5th scenario (new molecules discovered)

### Problem

Every year the WHOCC organization, shares a data for newly discovered molecules. We can work on it’s opportunities in Iran for creating and discovering new drugs, base on these data. In order to be capable of implementing such idea we need a proper crawler.

### Investigation

-

## 6th scenario (chat bot for use instructions in Persian)

### Problem

Base on the data provided by TTAC website we can be aware of drugs instructions and side effects. Then we can develop and use LLMs or similar ideas and platforms to develop a well stablished model in order to speak with people in native language and provide them with clean and concise information around a prescription, specific drug, or even patient centric usage routine and consume dosage base on their specific information and backgrounds.
